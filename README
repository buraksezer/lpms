L Package Management System -- lpms
===================================

About
-------

lpms is a package manager which was designed to provide advanced control and 
optimization over packages. It is written in Python entirely and uses custom 
Python scripts to build packages.

lpms aims to be functional, user-friendly, fast and powerful.

Dependencies
-------------

* lpms is written in Python-2.7.1. So you should use Python-2.7.x or Python-2.6.x. 
But 2.7 series is recommended.

* Python must be compiled with sqlite support. So lpms depends on sqlite.

* lpms uses 'catbox' as sandboxing application. You can find catbox in Hadron's main
repository.


Installation
-------------
lpms runs as a standard Python module. So you copy 'src' directory to Python's 
site-packages directory. Note that, src directory is named as 'lpms'. For details, 
see lpms' build script.
