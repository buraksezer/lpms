L Package Management System -- lpms
===================================


About
-------

lpms is a package manager which was designed to provide advanced control and 
optimization over the packages. It is written in Python entirely and uses custom 
Python scripts to build packages.

lpms aims to be functional, user-friendly, fast and powerful.

It is the heart of Hadron Project.


Dependencies
-------------

* lpms is written in Python-2.7

* Python-2.7.x must be compiled with sqlite3 support. So lpms depends on sqlite3.

* Uses sydbox as sandboxing application.
 
 Note: If you don't want to use sydbox, you must set sandbox as False in 
 /etc/lpms/build.conf.

* Uses 'magic' to check MIME types. The module is a part of file(sys-apps/file
 in Hadron GNU/Linux) package.

Installation
-------------

lpms runs as a standard Python module. So you should copy 'src' directory to Python's 
site-packages directory. Note that, src directory is named as 'lpms'. For details, 
see lpms' build script.
