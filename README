L Package Management System -- lpms
===================================


About
-------

Package manager of Hadron GNU/Linux is lpms. It is acronym of L Package Management System. 
L is meaningless.

It's written with Python. Designed to be fast, functional, ergonomic and user-friendly(KISS). 
lpms builds source codes with help of special Python scripts from repositories.

It can be used to install bleeding-edge packages. You can create a script to create a package 
that uses directly upstream code. We call these "live packages".

Developers/maintainers can create repositories managed by Git, Subversion or other version control systems. 
lpms can synchronize directly from content management systems.

Information about packages given via these scripts, but lpms has SQL backend to manage 
the huge information about packages and dependencies.
